<h1><a href=https://ursaw.github.io/posts/my_keyboard_evolution/ title="My Keyboard Evolution">My Keyboard Evolution</a></h1>
TL;DR This is my historically ordered journey into ergonomic keyboards. I try to explain the background of each choice, the advantages and limitations.
My main work on computers is coding, and I like terminals/consoles and try avoid using the mouse as much as possible.
From IBM model M to Dactyl split ortho keyboard for ergonomics and fun. I am still use QWERTY, but slowly moving to COLMAK DH.
It was an evolution with many small changes, today I advise a quick jump to a split ortho keyboard or mono blocks.

<h1><a href=https://ursaw.github.io/posts/python_dataclasses/ title="Python dataclasses">Python dataclasses</a></h1>
Background Although I work quite much with python I really hate the aspect of dynamically typing when using classes. In my opinion you should do on object oriented modelling to define attributes instead of adding attributes during runtime.
I would like to have something like perls use strict to at least define the attributes, even if the datatype is missing there.
Python 3.7, pep 557 introduced dataclasses to the default library, which enables the developer to do an object oriented modelling with python.

<h1><a href=https://ursaw.github.io/posts/keyboards/ title="Ergo Keyboards">Ergo Keyboards</a></h1>
Recently I digged into ergonomical mechanical split keyboards, which become a time consumption hobby due the corona times.
I like thinking of and building ergonomic input devices, especially keyboards, unfortunately its not only a hobby I also need it because of some pains due long working at the machine.

<h1><a href=https://ursaw.github.io/posts/thoughts_soflev1/ title="Some experience and thoughts about Sofle V1">Some experience and thoughts about Sofle V1</a></h1>
Two months ago I built a Sofle V1(Zealios 67g, DSA caps) that is my daily driver, but I have to admit that I am not as happy as I think I could or should be&mldr;
The reasons are the following:
This is my first column staggered keyboard, I had a few split afore because I am starting to suffer from RSI. When I switched from the Quefrency keyboard to the Sofle keyboard, I got quite a bit of pain extending from my thumb to my neck, which surprised me quite a bit because I thought it would be more ergonomic.
