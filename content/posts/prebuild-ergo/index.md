Ergo keyboards tend to be a nerdy topic, where you quite soon came to a point where you need to do
DYI with soldering.
Ergonomics in keyboards ia at least the [three angles](https://kbd.news/The-three-angles-of-ergonomics-1813.html) and ends up in highly subject aspects.

I want to give an overview of available (prebuilt) models for newbies into the ergo mechanical keyboard
scene. I have no experience with most of them, but I hope this represents the market of 2023.


## Split / Monoblock
First level of ergonomics, better to jump over this category, I don't know why I have presented so many...

{{< imageresize file="Dygma-defy-2.jpg"  opts="300x200"  alt="Dygma-defy"   caption="dygma.com/Dygma-defy">}} 

The [Dygma defy](https://dygma.com/pages/defy) is the ortho interpretation of Dygma. 





## Split Sculpted
[Kinesis](https://kinesis-ergo.com) somehow introduced sculpted keyboards. 

The open source keyboard ergodox was heavenly inspired by the iconic Kinesis Advantage. The sculpted version are called Dactyls.

### Kinesis

|  Keyboard | Image |
|----|----|

### Bastard Keyboards

https://bastardkb.com is a designer and builder of Dactyl like keyboards in different sizes. The keyboards are open source, available as kits or as prebuilds. Absolute worth to have a closer look, especially models with mouse devices, like the dactyl with a track ball.


The [Dilemma max](https://bastardkb.com/product/dilemma-max-prebuilt-preorder)  is a neat flat keyboard.
