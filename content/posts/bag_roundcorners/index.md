## Cutting Pattern for bag with round corners

Its quite simple to set up an cutting pattern for a bag as a cubus. You just need (2*(width+height)) x length and for the forehead side each  width x height plus stitching allowance.

Those sharp corners are not aesthetic at all and will be the first part of your bag to break. 

Therefore I developed a sheet to calculate a bag cutting pattern where you just input your dimensions of the bag and the (optional 2 different) roundings. 

You will get the distances to all entry, middle and exit points of the quarter circles (round edges) that you can sew the two peaces together.

### Radius helper
A simple and solid radius is 5cm. You can use a CD (diameter 12cm, radius with 1cm edge is 5cm) as a 5cm radius template.
