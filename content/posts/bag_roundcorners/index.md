## Cutting Pattern for bag with round corners

Its quite simple to set up an cutting pattern for a bag as a cubus. You just need (2*(width+height)) x length and for the forehead side each  width x height plus stitching allowance.

Those sharp corners are not aesthetic at all and will be the first part of your bag to break. 

Therefore I developed a sheet to calculate a bag cutting pattern where you just input your dimensions of the bag and the (optional 2 different) roundings. 

You will get the distances to all entry, middle and exit points of the quarter circles (round edges) that you can sew the two peaces together.

### Steps to do
1. Fill in the desired values in the green cells of the first table. All other values are dependend on the three dimensions and the three radius.
2. Lower part: Draw the upper part and make all markings on the outer side (e.g. upper Start,,,,11,7,,12,6,,1,5,....,END). Draw the circles on the parts. Now cut everything.
3. Upper part: The cutting dimension of the upper part are for the zipper region only. Therefore cut out the upper part, half it for the zipper and insert the zipper. Cut out outer segments (H_s) and sew them to the zipper area. check the overall dimensions (last values in upper_x and upper_y). Then draw the marks on the inner side and the radius. Cut out the upper part.
4. Add straps.
5. Put the outer side of the lower part and the inner side of the upper part on the sewing machine and start to sew them together. With this order you have the marks of upper and lower parts towards you.

### Radius helper
A simple and solid radius is 5cm. You can use a CD (diameter 12cm, radius with 1cm edge is 5cm) as a 5cm radius template.
