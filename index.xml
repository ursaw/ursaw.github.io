In my opinion you should do on object oriented modelling to define attributes instead of adding attributes during runtime.
I would like to have something like perls use strict to at least define the attributes, even if the datatype is missing there.
Python 3.7, pep 557 introduced dataclasses to the default library, which enables the developer to do an object oriented modelling with python.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://ursaw.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ursaw.github.io/about/</guid><description>This is a small example site generated with HUGO.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Keyboards</title><link>https://ursaw.github.io/posts/keyboards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ursaw.github.io/posts/keyboards/</guid><description>Recently I digged into ergonomical mechanical split keyboards, which become a time consumption hobby due the corona times.
I like thinking of and building ergonomic input devices, especially keyboards, unfortunately its not only a hobby I also need it because of some pains due long working at the machine.

The reasons are the following:
This is my first column staggered keyboard, I had a few split afore because I am starting to suffer from RSI. When I switched from the Quefrency keyboard to the Sofle keyboard, I got quite a bit of pain extending from my thumb to my neck, which surprised me quite a bit because I thought it would be more ergonomic.</description></item><item><title>Warsaw, Poland</title><link>https://ursaw.github.io/photos/warsaw-poland/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ursaw.github.io/photos/warsaw-poland/</guid><description>Palace of Culture and Science (Polish: Pałac Kultury i Nauki), is a notable high-rise building in central Warsaw, Poland.
