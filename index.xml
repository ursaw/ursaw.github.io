You just need (2*(width+height)) x length and for the forehead side each width x height plus stitching allowance.
Those sharp corners are not aesthetic at all and will be the first part of your bag to break.
Therefore I developed a sheet to calculate a bag cutting pattern where you just input your dimensions of the bag and the (optional 2 different) roundings.</description></item><item><title>My Keyboard Evolution</title><link>https://ursaw.github.io/posts/my_keyboard_evolution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ursaw.github.io/posts/my_keyboard_evolution/</guid><description>TL;DR This is my historically ordered journey into ergonomic keyboards. I try to explain the background of each choice, the advantages and limitations.
My main work on computers is coding, and I like terminals/consoles and try avoid using the mouse as much as possible.
From IBM model M to Dactyl split ortho keyboard for ergonomics and fun. I am still use QWERTY, but slowly moving to COLMAK DH.
It was an evolution with many small changes, today I advise a quick jump to a split ortho keyboard or mono blocks.</description></item><item><title>Kb_scylla</title><link>https://ursaw.github.io/photos/kb_scylla/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 17:26:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ursaw.github.io/photos/kb_scylla/</guid><description> https://bastardkb.com/scylla Gazzew Boba U4 Silent Tactile Switch 62g Kensington Expert trackball</description></item><item><title>Kb Dactyl monoblock</title><link>https://ursaw.github.io/photos/kb_dactyl_monoblock/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 17:25:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ursaw.github.io/photos/kb_dactyl_monoblock/</guid><description>Handwired Dactyl monoblock with Gateron Brown and pro-micro.

In my opinion you should do on object oriented modelling to define attributes instead of adding attributes during runtime.
I would like to have something like perls use strict to at least define the attributes, even if the datatype is missing there.
Python 3.7, pep 557 introduced dataclasses to the default library, which enables the developer to do an object oriented modelling with python.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://ursaw.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ursaw.github.io/about/</guid><description>This is a small example site generated with HUGO.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Keyboards</title><link>https://ursaw.github.io/posts/keyboards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ursaw.github.io/posts/keyboards/</guid><description>Recently I digged into ergonomical mechanical split keyboards, which become a time consumption hobby due the corona times.
I like thinking of and building ergonomic input devices, especially keyboards, unfortunately its not only a hobby I also need it because of some pains due long working at the machine.

The reasons are the following:
This is my first column staggered keyboard, I had a few split afore because I am starting to suffer from RSI. When I switched from the Quefrency keyboard to the Sofle keyboard, I got quite a bit of pain extending from my thumb to my neck, which surprised me quite a bit because I thought it would be more ergonomic.</description></item><item><title>What is Hugo</title><link>https://ursaw.github.io/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ursaw.github.io/posts/introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
